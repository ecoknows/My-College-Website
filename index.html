                My real name is Jerico. I live at tondo manila, I was raise and born
                by my single mother and my eldest siblings. Since when I was a child until now
                I'm inlove with the cosmos, the mystery of the vast universe. I dream to explore
                the edge of universe, discover new planets, fly across different solar systems and
                discover new biodiversity. I also dream to become an inventor that will shapes the 
                future.

                Yes, I really love watching anime reading them on mangas, and also I love japanese 
                people, on how can they be so discipline, generous and respectful. Until now I'm
                watching anime on my spare time, if I have no work to do like projects and coding, 
                Anime is my resting place, the one that calms my mind. I also love japanese music 
                because eventhough I can't understand the lyrics I can feel the emotions on it.
                I didn't say I don't like my own countryman. Also anime makes my mind more creative
                sometimes I design my projects base on an anime. I also dream to create games that
                is based on an Anime. Yep my Waifu is Asuna from Sword Art Online as you can see on
                the first picture. I didn't care on how people react on me, on tellingme  how childish
                of me to watch some kiddy shows, I understand them, I'm just enjoying my life.

                Oh, I forgot to talk about my life as a CS student. I'm currently studying in 
                Technological University of the Philippines. Being a CS student is so stressful but 
                fun, fun to create programs, from simple Hello World to something more productive.
                I'm more of a person who is so amaze when a simple thing that I learn. I appreciate
                things I understand things base on my intellectual capability and emotional approach
                I'm inlove with coding since when I was on highschool, at first I was inspired to 
                create games because I really love plaing games, from simple pixel games to highly 
                graphical games, from that it leads me to create countless of programminga projects 
                like programming logics, mobile and computer games and applications which either
                unfinished or I forgot to continue.

                My ultimate goal in life is to be happy, enjoy every seconds in my life, travel more 
                with my family while being productive, have my own family and watch more animes. 
                Talking about on my career,in the near future, I want to become software developer
                or even an engineer if I was lucky enough, build my own developer team, plan and 
                build software projects, build an organization that will shapes the future. And Yes
                my childhood dream, I want to become an astronaut, or create my own space company or
                work from NASA. I'll study hard and work hard while I'm enjoying with my life.
